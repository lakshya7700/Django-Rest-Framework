# What is an API?

It stands of Application Programming Interface.

## For example: 

Imagine you are a user who wants something from the web, like information or a service.
You connect to web services and send a request to a web server.

Will the web server give you a response to that request? Is it capable of providing the exact response you need?
The answer is NO.

For this purpose, we build APIs. APIs are programs designed to give you the correct response for your request.
They determine what service is being asked for and ensure the correct response is sent back to the user.

## lets take a more simplified example

Suppose you go to a restaurant. There are many types of cuisines to choose from. You call the waiter and tell them that you want Chinese food. The waiter goes to the chef and communicates your order.

Later, you decide you want a dessert. Again, you call the waiter, who informs the chef, and you receive your order.

You don’t directly go to the chef to ask for the food you want.
In this analogy:

- The waiter is the API.
- The chef is the database/server where all the information or services are stored.

I hope this gives you a much clearer idea of what an API is and why it’s used.

# Types of API

- REST API
- SOAP API
- RPC API
- GraphQL

We will discuss about all these APIs further!!
